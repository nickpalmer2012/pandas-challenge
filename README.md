The most difficult part of this challenge was the "School Summary" dataframe where we needed to include several series that were grouped by school name by utilizing the "groupby" method in Pandas. 

I went over our sorting example from class to determine that I would group each column by the school name and apply a function to each of the statistics I needed to evaluate.

I had to first make sure that each column of the summary dataframe printed exacly the same way, with the 15 school names as "keys" on the left and the values for each calculation on the right.
